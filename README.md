# Food_Ordering_System
A Console Application written in Java.
This console application uses different java classes for the specific sub-menu items.
After that a main class is created in which we display the main menu wwhere starters, Main Course etc. are listed.
It takes an user input to select those items through which it calculates the amount of the specific item.
and ends with printing the bill with items you have ordered.
